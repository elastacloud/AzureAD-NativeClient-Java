NativeClient-Java
===================

This sample demonstrates a web API in JSP that is secured using Azure AD. The consumer can obtain a JWT access token through the OAuth 2.0 protocol. The access token is sent to the web API to authenticate the user. The web API uses java to validate the access token. 

For more information about how the protocols work in this scenario and other scenarios, see [Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=394414). 

Refer to [https://github.com/azureadsamples/nativeclient-dotnet](https://github.com/azureadsamples/nativeclient-dotnet) for how to generate a bearer token, then use this token at http://localhost:8080/secure/passive.
